Some examples of angular concepts

Uses parcel to package up the app and lazy routing/organization of everything into modules.  I can refer back to this for examples of how to develop angular components.

## Goals
 - Simple
 - Organized
 - Testable
 - Resistant to complexity over time

## Running
`
npm run app:start
`

## TODO
 - [ ] Add testing examples
